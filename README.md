# An Introduction to Python
## The second Kathmandu Astrophysics School
#### By Jack Line, June 2018
This course will be taught out of jupyter notebooks, which are contained in this `git` repository. Any amendments or solutions created during the course will be added whenever ready.

I will look to add example answers to the exercises once the course has finished, so you can go back and compare yours (and see if yours are better than mine! :-) )
